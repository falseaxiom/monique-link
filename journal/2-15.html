        i am so fascinated by brander's idea of "semantic triple as link". i didn't really know
        what a semantic triple was before reading this article--it makes sense as a general
        grammatical concept, though. but hearing about it in the same context as links is kind of
        mind-blowing!
        <br/><br/>
        the mit talk and rasheed's piece have an interesting conversation with one another--i
        believe the former references the latter at some point.
