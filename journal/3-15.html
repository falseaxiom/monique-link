            <h1>72 seasons research</h1>

            i loved reading about the 72 seasons over spring break; while observing the changes in nature at home and on campus, it was
            interesting to try to see how/if they aligned with the k≈ç. i don't think the japanese seasonal calendar quite aligns with
            how the seasons change in new jersey, but the general ideas associated with each pocket of time over the year make sense,
            thinking about how seasons typically progress. research-wise, i was surprised to learn that the calendar's terms were largely
            taken from chinese sources. i also liked how nature-oriented the calendar was as a whole; it's not really meant for keeping track
            of time, events, or pertinent deadlines, so much as taking it slow and being one with the world. it's kind of the opposite of what
            a calendar is used for nowadays.

            while researching, i also found a mobile app called "72 seasons", which on any given day shows you the microseason you are currently
            in (assuming you live in japan), a blurb about that season, and some events, animals, foods, and activities associated with the
            season. i downloaded it over break and have been delighted whenever i check it, getting to slow down and read about nature. i also
            enjoy the design of the app, which the developers noted is based on japanese scrolls, as you have to scroll left-to-right to
            read everything, as opposed to the vertical scrolling nature of most apps these days.
