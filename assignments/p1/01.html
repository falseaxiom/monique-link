        Seventeen minutes ago, I was in love<br/>
        with the cashier and a cinnamon pull-apart,<br/>
        seven minutes before that, it was a gray-<br/>
        <br/>
        haired man in argyle socks, a woman<br/>
        dancing outside the bakery holding<br/>
        a cigarette and broken umbrella. The rain,<br/>
        <br/>
        I've fallen in love with it many times,<br/>
        the fog, the frost—how it covers the clovers<br/>
        —and by clovers I mean lovers.<br/>
        <br/>
        And now I'm thinking how much I want to rush up<br/>
        to the stranger in the plaid wool hat<br/>
        and tell him how much I love his eyes,<br/>
        <br/>
        all those fireworks, every seventeen minutes, exploding<br/>
        in my head—you the baker, you the novelist,<br/>
        you the reader, you the homeless man on the corner<br/>
        <br/>
        with the strong hands—I've thought about you. But<br/>
        in this world we've been taught to keep<br/>
        our emotions tight, a rubberband ball we worry<br/>
        <br/>
        if one band loosens, the others will begin shooting off<br/>
        in so many directions. So we quiet.<br/>
        I quiet. I eat my cinnamon bread<br/>
        <br/>
        in the bakery watching the old man still sitting<br/>
        at his table, moving his napkin as he drinks<br/>
        his small cup of coffee, and I never say,<br/>
        <br/>
        I think you're beautiful, except in my head,<br/>
        except I decide I can't<br/>
        live this way, and walk over to him and<br/>
        <br/>
        place my hand on his shoulder, lean in close<br/>
        and whisper, I love your argyle socks,<br/>
        and he grabs my hand,<br/>
        <br/>        
        the way a memory holds tight in the smallest<br/>
        corner. He smiles and says,<br/>
        I always hope someone will notice.<br/>
        <br/>
