        <h1>Seventeen minutes ago,</h1>
        <h2>I was in love with the cashier and a cinnamon pull-apart,</h2>
        <h3>seven minutes before that,</h3>
        <h4>it was a gray- haired man in argyle socks,</h4>
        <h5>a woman dancing outside the bakery holding a cigarette and broken umbrella.</h5>
        <h1>The rain,</h1>
        <h2>I've fallen in love with it many times,</h2>
        <h3>the fog,</h3>
        <h4>the frost—</h4>
        <h5>how it covers the clovers—</h5>
        <h6>and by clovers I mean lovers.</h6>
        <h1>And now I'm thinking how much I want to rush up to the stranger in the plaid wool hat and tell him how much I love his eyes,</h1>
        <h2>all those fireworks, every seventeen minutes, exploding in my head—</h2>
        <h3>you the baker,</h3>
        <h4>you the novelist,</h4>
        <h5>you the reader,</h5>
        <h6>you the homeless man on the corner with the strong hands—I've thought about you.</h6>
        <h1>But in this world we've been taught to keep our emotions tight,</h1>
        <h2>a rubberband ball we worry if one band loosens,</h2>
        <h3>the others will begin shooting off in so many directions.</h3>
        <br/>
        <h6>So we quiet.</h6>
        <h6>I quiet.</h6>
        <br/>
        <h6>I eat my cinnamon bread in the bakery watching the old man still sitting at his table,</h6>
        <h6>moving his napkin as he drinks his small cup of coffee,</h6>
        <h6>and I never say,</h6>
        <h5>I think you're beautiful,</h5>
        <h6>except in my head,</h6>
        <h5>except I decide I can't live this way,</h5>
        <h4>and walk over to him and place my hand on his shoulder,</h4>
        <h3>lean in close and whisper,</h3>
        <h2>I love your argyle socks,</h2>
        <h4>and he grabs my hand,</h4>
        <h3>the way a memory holds tight in the smallest corner.</h3>
        <h2>He smiles and says,</h2>
        <h1>I always hope someone will notice.</h1>
