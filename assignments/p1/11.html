            Seventeen minutes ago, I was in love<br/>
            with the cashier and a cinnamon pull-apart,<br/>
            seven minutes before that, it was a gray-
        </div>
        <div style="border-style:dashed">
            haired man in argyle socks, a woman<br/>
            dancing outside the bakery holding<br/>
            a cigarette and broken umbrella. The rain,
        </div>
        <div style="border-style:dotted">
            I've fallen in love with it many times,<br/>
            the fog, the frost—how it covers the clovers<br/>
            —and by clovers I mean lovers.
        </div>
        <div style="border-style:double">
            And now I'm thinking how much I want to rush up<br/>
            to the stranger in the plaid wool hat<br/>
            and tell him how much I love his eyes,
        </div>
        <div>
            all those fireworks, every seventeen minutes, exploding<br/>
            in my head—you the baker, you the novelist,<br/>
            you the reader, you the homeless man on the corner
        </div>
        <div style="border-style:dashed">
            with the strong hands—I've thought about you. But<br/>
            in this world we've been taught to keep<br/>
            our emotions tight, a rubberband ball we worry
        </div>
        <div style="border-style:dotted">
            if one band loosens, the others will begin shooting off<br/>
            in so many directions. So we quiet.<br/>
            I quiet. I eat my cinnamon bread
        </div>
        <div style="border-style:double">
            in the bakery watching the old man still sitting<br/>
            at his table, moving his napkin as he drinks<br/>
            his small cup of coffee, and I never say,
        </div>
        <div>
            I think you're beautiful, except in my head,<br/>
            except I decide I can't<br/>
            live this way, and walk over to him and
        </div>
        <div style="border-style:dashed">
            place my hand on his shoulder, lean in close<br/>
            and whisper, I love your argyle socks,<br/>
            and he grabs my hand,
        </div>
        <div style="border-style:dotted">
            the way a memory holds tight in the smallest<br/>
            corner. He smiles and says,<br/>
            I always hope someone will notice.
