                Seventeen minutes ago, I was in <span style="font-weight: 700; color: red">love</span><br/>
                with the cashier and a cinnamon pull-apart,<br/>
                seven minutes before that, it was a gray-
            </p>
            <p>
                haired man in argyle socks, a woman<br/>
                dancing outside the bakery holding<br/>
                a cigarette and broken umbrella. The rain,
            </p>
            <p>
                I've fallen in  <span style="font-weight: 700; color: red">love</span> with it many times,<br/>
                the fog, the frost—how it covers the clovers<br/>
                —and by clovers I mean  <span style="font-weight: 700; color: red">lovers</span>.
            </p>
            <p>
                And now I'm thinking how much I want to rush up<br/>
                to the stranger in the plaid wool hat<br/>
                and tell him how much I  <span style="font-weight: 700; color: red">love</span> his eyes,
            </p>
            <p>
                all those fireworks, every seventeen minutes, exploding<br/>
                in my head—you the baker, you the novelist,<br/>
                you the reader, you the homeless man on the corner
            </p>
            <p>
                with the strong hands—I've thought about you. But<br/>
                in this world we've been taught to keep<br/>
                our emotions tight, a rubberband ball we worry
            </p>
            <p>
                if one band loosens, the others will begin shooting off<br/>
                in so many directions. So we quiet.<br/>
                I quiet. I eat my cinnamon bread
            </p>
            <p>
                in the bakery watching the old man still sitting<br/>
                at his table, moving his napkin as he drinks<br/>
                his small cup of coffee, and I never say,
            </p>
            <p>
                <em>I think you're beautiful,</em> except in my head,<br/>
                except I decide I can't<br/>
                live this way, and walk over to him and
            </p>
            <p>
                place my hand on his shoulder, lean in close<br/>
                and whisper, <em>I  <span style="font-weight: 700; color: red">love</span> your argyle socks,</em><br/>
                and he grabs my hand,
            </p>
            <p>
                the way a memory holds tight in the smallest<br/>
                corner. He smiles and says,<br/>
                <em>I always hope someone will notice.</em>
            </p>
