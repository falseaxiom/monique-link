        <li>Seventeen minutes ago, I was in love
        with the cashier and a cinnamon pull-apart,
        seven minutes before that, it was a gray-
        haired man in argyle socks, a woman
        dancing outside the bakery holding
        a cigarette and broken umbrella.</li> <li>The rain,
        I've fallen in love with it many times,
        the fog, the frost—how it covers the clovers
        —and by clovers I mean lovers.</li>
        <li>And now I'm thinking how much I want to rush up
        to the stranger in the plaid wool hat
        and tell him how much I love his eyes,
        all those fireworks, every seventeen minutes, exploding
        in my head—you the baker, you the novelist,
        you the reader, you the homeless man on the corner
        with the strong hands—I've thought about you.</li> <li>But
        in this world we've been taught to keep
        our emotions tight, a rubberband ball we worry
        if one band loosens, the others will begin shooting off
        in so many directions.</li> <li>So we quiet.</li>
        <li>I quiet.</li> <li>I eat my cinnamon bread
        in the bakery watching the old man still sitting
        at his table, moving his napkin as he drinks
        his small cup of coffee, and I never say,
        I think you're beautiful, except in my head,
        except I decide I can't
        live this way, and walk over to him and
        place my hand on his shoulder, lean in close
        and whisper, I love your argyle socks,
        and he grabs my hand,
        the way a memory holds tight in the smallest
        corner.</li> <li>He smiles and says,
        I always hope someone will notice.</li>
    </ol>
