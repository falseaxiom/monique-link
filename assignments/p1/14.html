                <span>Seventeen minutes ago,</span> I was <span>love</span><br/>
                with the cashier and a cinnamon <span>pull-</span>apart,<br/>
                seven minutes before that, it was a gray-
            </p>
            <p>
                hair<span>ed</span> man in argyle socks, a woman<br/>
                dancing outside the bakery holding<br/>
                a cigarette and broken umbrella. The <span>rain</span>,
            </p>
            <p>
                I've <span>fallen</span> in love with it many times,<br/>
                the fog, the frost—how it covers the clovers<br/>
                —and by clovers I mean <span>lovers</span>.
            </p>
            <p>
                And now I'm <span>thinking how</span> much I want to rush up<br/>
                to the stranger in the plaid wool hat<br/>
                and tell him how much <span>I love</span> his eyes,
            </p>
            <p>
                all those fireworks, every seventeen minutes, exploding<br/>
                in my head—<span>you</span> the baker, <span>you</span> the novelist,<br/>
                you the reader, <span>you</span> the homeless man on the corner
            </p>
            <p>
                with the strong hands—<span>I've thought about you.</span> But<br/>
                in this world <span>we</span>'ve been taught to <span>keep</span><br/>
                <span>our</span> emotions tight, a rubberband ball we <span>worry</span>
            </p>
            <p>
                if one band loosens, the others will begin shooting off<br/>
                in so many directions. So we <span>quiet.</span><br/>
                I quiet. <span>I</span> eat my cinnamon bread
            </p>
            <p>
                in the bakery <span>watch</span>ing the old man still sitting<br/>
                at his table, moving his napkin as he drinks<br/>
                his small cup of coffee, and I never say,
            </p>
            <p>
                I think <span>you</span>'re <span>beautiful,</span> except in my head,<br/>
                except I decide I can't<br/>
                live this way, and walk over to him and
            </p>
            <p>
                place my hand on his shoulder, lean in close<br/>
                and whisper, <span>I</span> love your argyle socks,<br/>
                and he grabs my hand,
            </p>
            <p>
                the way a memory <span>hold</span>s <span>tight</span> in the smallest<br/>
                corner. He smiles and says,<br/>
                I always <span>hope</span> someone will notice.
            </p>
