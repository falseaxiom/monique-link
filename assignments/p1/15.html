            <h1>seven minutes before that,</h1>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h1>it was a gray-
            haired man in argyle socks,</h1>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h1>a woman
            dancing outside the bakery holding

            And now I'm thinking how much I want to rush up
            to the stranger in the plaid wool hat
            and tell him how much I love his eyes,
        </div>
                

        <div>
            all those fireworks,
        </div>
        
        <div>
            every seventeen minutes,
        </div>
        
        <div>
            exploding
            in my head—
        </div>
        
        <div>
            you the baker,
        </div>
        
        <div>
            you the novelist,
        </div>
        
        <div>
            you the reader,
        </div>
        
        <div>
            you the homeless man on the corner
            with the strong hands—
        </div>
        
        <div>
            I've thought about you.
        </div>
        
        <div>
            But
            in this world we've been taught to keep
            our emotions tight,
        </div>
        
        <div>
            a rubberband ball we worry
            if one band loosens,
        </div>
        
        <div>
            the others will begin shooting off
            in so many directions.
        </div>
        
        <div>
            So we quiet.
        </div>
        
        <div>
            I quiet.
        </div>
        
        <div>
            I eat my cinnamon bread
            in the bakery watching the old man still sitting
            at his table,
        </div>
        
        <div>
            moving his napkin as he drinks
            his small cup of coffee,
        </div>
        
        <div>
            and I never say,
        </div>
        
        <div>
            I think you're beautiful,
        </div>
        
        <div>
            except in my head,
        </div>
        
        <div>
            except I decide I can't
            live this way,
        </div>
        
        <div>
            and walk over to him and
            place my hand on his shoulder,
        </div>
        
        <div>
            lean in close
            and whisper,
        </div>
        
        <div>
            I love your argyle socks,
        </div>
        
        <div>
            and he grabs my hand,
        </div>
        
        <div>
            the way a memory holds tight in the smallest
            corner.
        </div>
        
        <div>
            He smiles and says,
        </div>
        
        <div>
            I always hope someone will notice.
        </div>
