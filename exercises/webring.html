  Answers to <a href="https://sekinat-link.neocities.org/webring.html">Sekinat</a>'s questions:  
  <ol>
    <li>My name is Monique! I am a COS major from New Jersey.</li>
    <li>Growing up in suburban NJ made me a bit sheltered, I think--but being a person of color in a predominately white town made me more aware of social issues. And being very online throughout my childhood gave me a lot more perspectives than just interacting with people in real life... although it may have stunted my social skills a bit :')</li>
    <li>I like to draw and write! But mostly I just watch YouTube videos. My favorite "genre" is Korean college students quietly making dinner.</li>
  </ol>
