        <ul>
            <li>Seventeen minutes ago, I was in love with the cashier and a cinnamon pull-apart,</li>
            <li>seven minutes before that, it was a gray-haired man in argyle socks,</li>
            <li>a woman dancing outside the bakery holding a cigarette and broken umbrella.</li>
            <li>The rain, I've fallen in love with it many times,</li>
            <li>the fog, the frost—how it covers the clovers—</li>
            <ul>
                <li>and by clovers I mean lovers.</li>
            </ul>
            <li>And now I'm thinking how much I want to rush upto the stranger in the plaid wool hat and tell him how much I love his eyes,</li>
            <li>all those fireworks, every seventeen minutes, exploding in my head—</li>
            <ul>
                <li>you the baker,</li>
                <li>you the novelist,</li>
                <li>you the reader,</li>
                <li>you the homeless man on the corner with the strong hands—</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>I've thought about you.</li>
                </ul>
            </ul>
            <li>But in this world we've been taught to keep our emotions tight,</li>
            <li>a rubberband ball we worry if one band loosens, the others will begin</li>
            <ul>
                <li>shooting</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>off</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>in</li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>so</li>
                            <ul>
                                <li>many</li>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>directions.</li>
                                </ul>
                            </ul>
                        </ul>
                    </ul>
                </ul>
            </ul>
            <li>So we quiet.</li>
            <ul>
                <li>I quiet.</li>
            </ul>
            <li>I eat my cinnamon bread in the bakery</li>
            <li>watching the old man still sitting at his table, moving his napkin as he drinks his small cup of coffee,</li>
            <li>and I never say,</li>
            <ul>
                <li>I think you're beautiful,</li>
            </ul>
            <li>except in my head,</li>
            <li>except I decide I can't live this way,</li>
            <li>and walk over to him and place my hand on his shoulder,</li>
            <li>lean in close and whisper,</li>
            <ul>
                <li>I love your argyle socks,</li>
            </ul>
            <li>and he grabs my hand,</li>
            <li>the way a memory holds tight in the smallest corner.</li>
            <li>He smiles and says,</li>
            <ul>
                <li>I always hope someone will notice.</li>
            </ul>
        </ul>
