        Seventeen minutes ago, I was in love<br/>
        with the <strong>cashier</strong> and a <strong>cinnamon pull-apart,</strong><br/>
        seven minutes before that, it was a <strong>gray-<br/>
        <br/>
        haired man</strong> in <strong>argyle socks,</strong> a <strong>woman</strong><br/>
        dancing outside the <strong>bakery</strong> holding<br/>
        a <strong>cigarette</strong> and <strong>broken umbrella.</strong> The <strong>rain,</strong><br/>
        <br/>
        I've fallen in love with it many times,<br/>
        the <strong>fog,</strong> the <strong>frost</strong>—how it covers the <strong>clovers</strong><br/>
        —and by <strong>clovers</strong> I mean <strong>lovers.</strong><br/>
        <br/>
        And now I'm thinking how much I want to rush up<br/>
        to the <strong>stranger</strong> in the <strong>plaid wool hat</strong><br/>
        and tell him how much I love his <strong>eyes,</strong><br/>
        <br/>
        all those <strong>fireworks,</strong> every seventeen minutes, exploding<br/>
        in my head—you the <strong>baker,</strong> you the <strong>novelist,</strong><br/>
        you the <strong>reader,</strong> you the <strong>homeless man</strong> on the corner<br/>
        <br/>
        with the <strong>strong hands</strong>—I've thought about you. But<br/>
        in this world we've been taught to keep<br/>
        our emotions tight, a <strong>rubberband ball</strong> we worry<br/>
        <br/>
        if one band loosens, the others will begin shooting off<br/>
        in so many directions. So we quiet.<br/>
        I quiet. I eat my <strong>cinnamon bread</strong><br/>
        <br/>
        in the <strong>bakery</strong> watching the <strong>old man</strong> still sitting<br/>
        at his <strong>table,</strong> moving his <strong>napkin</strong> as he drinks<br/>
        his <strong>small cup of coffee,</strong> and I never say,<br/>
        <br/>
        <em>I think you're beautiful,</em> except in my head,<br/>
        except I decide I can't<br/>
        live this way, and walk over to him and<br/>
        <br/>
        place my hand on his shoulder, lean in close<br/>
        and whisper, <em>I love your argyle socks,</em><br/>
        and he grabs my hand,<br/>
        <br/>        
        the way a memory holds tight in the smallest<br/>
        corner. He smiles and says,<br/>
        <em>I always hope someone will notice.</em><br/>
        <br/>
